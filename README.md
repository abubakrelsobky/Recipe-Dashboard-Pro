## Notes

The API limit is incredibly low. I have a fully fucntional app. However, I could not even complete a GIF walkthrough because it just hits the daily limit. I suggest removing the spoonacular API from the listed options in future courses and only incldue ones that have reasonable limits. **Update:** I was able to show full fucntionality over 2 GIF files (part 1 and part 2). The address bar of the web browser is shown at the end of the first GIF video as required.
